## Programing	
I am new to Github and R. I have questions in Teams about Markdown elements. I may need to create another commit. I took the Python course last term. This feels very different so far. 
### Learning Approach
I like to watch videos and see images of what I need to do. I can follow directions in written form, but it is more difficult for me to process.
